# Allergic project
This project is a console program that downloads data about current allergens in the air from the website 
[www.medicover.pl/kalendarz-pylenia](https://www.medicover.pl/kalendarz-pylenia/).
## Usage
Install required [cpr library](https://github.com/libcpr/cpr), compile and run main.cpp. Then follow the
instructions provided in the console. 

## Features
This program works for all of Poland. Before you use it, you will be requested to choose your region. They are all
listed on the [website](https://www.medicover.pl/kalendarz-pylenia/). After you choose it, it will
be saved in the file, so you don't have to do this every time. In the console you will see information
about all the described allergens that are currently active as well as information about their
intensity and clinical significance.
